								<h3>Changing Thoughts on Teaching</h3>
								<i>June 21, 2016</i><br>
								<p>When I first got my internship at UTeach, I was slightly worried. I hadn't really ever taught before, and I have a bit of a hard time relating to kids. By that I mean that they usually don't understand my
									sarcasm, and most of my dark humor isn't fit for a classroom of 6th graders. While being trained for the position, I got the impression that I wouldn't be the one teaching the Arduino lessons, but instead
									I would be assisting an actual teacher.</p>

								<p>The friday before camp started, I found out that I would be leading the Arduino lessons for 8 hours per day, 4 hours per class. The other intern I worked with did not know much about Arduino, so I was basically
									in charge.</p>
									<i>Sidenote: For as long as I can remember, I have lived with mild anxiety. Another characteristic I get from my mom. For the most part, its very mild, but I have had bigger instances of it occasionally. Usually,
										before something big happens in my life, some mild general anxiety will keep me from sleep the night before.</i>
								<p> I didn't sleep much the night before. The morning arrived, and I started teaching like it was not my first day. It felt natural even. It helps that the kids were easy to teach because they were really quick to learn.

								<h3>A Summer of Creation</h3>
								<i>May 21, 2016</i><br>
								<p>Every summer of my life thus far has been unproductive. Every fall I return to school having lost much of the academic progress that I made in the spring.
								This summer I will be spending it away from home for the most part. I will spend my time in Austin, where I will be working for UTeach, a summer camp for middle and high school students.
								I'm going to be teaching kids the basics of the Arduino microcontroller, as well as assisting a teacher with an Engineering class. Aside from that, I will be working on TruRecruit, graphic design, HackTX, and whatever other creative project I
								come up with. Its time for me to make positive change. </p>

								<p>This will be a summer of growth and creation.</p>

								<h3>Learning Back End for TruRecruit</h3>
								<i>April 26, 2016</i><br>
								<p>The journey of TruRecruit started in February 2016 during uMAD, which is an all day developer's conference on UT's campus. I ran into Jesse, who I had met at HackTX 2015.
								He told me of the idea of TruRecruit, and I said I was on board pretty quickly. Shortly after, we discussed it with Bongani, who also jumped on board quickly.
								During the next few weeks, we slowly started to work on our web app. As a start, we found and used a <a href="https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter">Hackathon Starter</a>
								by Sahat as a base. This worked great because it was essentially a big MEAN stack template that had user authentication built-in using OAuth2.</p>

								<p>Coming into TruRecruit, my experience in backend web development consisted of only a few node and mongodb tutorials. Luckily for me, I learn best under pressure, so I did my
								best to learn the MEAN stack for TruRecruit. While researching the best way for us to upload resume's, I came across AWS S3. This solution was so much better than the local storage
								idea I thought we would use. While trying to implement S3 with Node, I read various developer articles on the increased performance of using Golang as a backend language. Specifically,
								I learned that handling hundreds of requests in a short time (like TruRecruit will hopefully do) to a service like S3 would be better done with Go as a backend language.
								Currently, I am implementing our landing page and login/signup pages in the Go web framework Revel. I hope to have authentication soon, with file upload in S3 to follow.</p>
